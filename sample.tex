		\item[\texttt{citegit}]
		This command displays a reference to a snapshot of a file in the git
		repository.
		The length of the displayed commit hash is controlled by the \verb+hashes+
		package option; the default hash length is \verb+[hashes=10]+.
		\item[\texttt{githash}]
		This command displays the full hash of the latest commit, currently \texttt{\githash}.
		\item[\texttt{gitdate}]
